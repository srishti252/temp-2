## Image Guidelines

For best results with the Dark Knight theme:

### Profile & About Images
- Use images with darker backgrounds or add dark overlay
- High contrast images work best
- Professional headshots with darker clothing/backgrounds complement the theme

### Project Thumbnails
- Dark-toned project screenshots or mockups
- Consider adding a slight dark overlay to maintain theme consistency
- Consistent dimensions for all project images

### Client/Testimonial Photos
- Professional headshots
- Square format, will be displayed as circles
- Consistent size and style

## Image Optimization

To ensure fast loading times:

1. Compress all images using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
2. Use JPG format for photographs
3. Keep file sizes under 200KB when possible
4. Use PNG format for the pattern texture if transparency is needed

## Customization Tips

- The template uses yellow accent colors by default (`--accent: #fcce00`), but you can easily customize this in the CSS
- If changing the accent color, consider updating image selections to complement the new color
- Dark, moody images with high contrast will work best with this theme
